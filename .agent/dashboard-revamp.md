# Task: Dashboard Revamp for Growth & Velocity

## 📋 Objective
Transform the dashboard from a static data display into a high-velocity action hub that provides small business owners with a sense of rapid growth and helps them make decisions faster.

## 🛠️ Changes

### 1. Header & Growth Pulse
- [ ] Add "Growth Momentum" indicator next to the store name (e.g., "Up 40% this week").
- [ ] Implement a more dynamic welcome message from the AI.

### 2. Next Actions Hub (P0)
- [ ] Create a "Ready to Ship" or "Pending Actions" section with batch confirm buttons.
- [ ] Move these critical tasks to the top of the interaction flow.

### 3. KPI Enhancements (P1)
- [ ] Add comparative metrics (e.g., vs last 24h) to all KPICards.
- [ ] Ensure "Revenue" is the primary focused metric.
- [ ] Add subtle "Growth" animations/badges.

### 4. Layout Optimization (P2)
- [ ] Shrink the "AI Token Usage" card to a more compact format.
- [ ] Replace the large AI card with a more functional "Operational Live Feed".
- [ ] Add "Celebration" triggers for milestones.

### 5. Interaction Polish
- [ ] Add staggered entrance animations.
- [ ] Implement meaningful micro-interactions for action buttons.

## 🧪 Verification Plan
- [ ] Visual audit: Does it look premium and non-generic?
- [ ] Speed audit: Can a user confirm all pending orders in < 3 seconds?
- [ ] Growth audit: Is at least one growth-centric metric visible without scrolling?
